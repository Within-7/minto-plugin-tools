# Memo Command

This command records work information using the work-memo skill's capabilities. It's designed for information recording only - no task execution.

## Usage

Run this command with your work information:
```
/memo 填写的信息
```

Or provide a URL to fetch and summarize webpage content:
```
/memo https://example.com/article
```

## Process

1. **Parse the input** to extract work details from natural language or URL
2. **Identify dimensions** (type, urgency, importance, tags, contexts, dates)
3. **For URLs**: Fetch webpage content, extract and summarize
4. **Record the information** using the work-memo storage system
5. **Return confirmation** with recorded details

## Implementation

   - Tags (#work, #urgent, #project)
   - Contexts (@office, @home, @phone)
