# OKR Planner

Design effective OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) with structured monthly planning cycles.

## Overview

OKRs align teams around measurable goals. This skill provides templates, best practices, and structured approaches for creating OKRs at different time scales (monthly, quarterly, annually).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new monthly OKR
# Use the template: assets/monthly-okr-template.md
```

**Decision Tree**:
- Monthly OKRs? → Use `assets/monthly-okr-template.md`
- Quarterly OKRs? → Combine 3 monthly OKRs, adjust time horizons
- Annual OKRs? → Start with quarterly, then aggregate
- Team OKRs? → Add alignment sections and dependencies

## Phase 1: Define Objectives

**Goal**: Create clear, inspirational objectives

### Objective Criteria

Each objective should be:
- **Qualitative** - Directional, not numeric
- **Ambitious** - Stretch goal, 60-70% achievement is good
- **Time-bound** - Clear deadline (monthly/quarterly)
- **Aligned** - Supports broader team/company goals

### Objective Examples

**Good**:
- "Delight users with an intuitive onboarding experience"
- "Scale infrastructure to handle 10x growth"
- "Establish engineering excellence culture"

**Bad**:
- "Improve onboarding" (too vague)
- "Add 5 new features" (this is a Key Result, not an Objective)
- "Fix bugs" (not inspirational)

---

## Phase 2: Define Key Results

**Goal**: Create measurable outcomes for each objective

### Key Result Criteria

Each Key Result should be:
- **Quantitative** - Number-based metrics
- **Measurable** - Can track progress objectively
- **Achievable** - Realistic but challenging
- **Time-bound** - Clear deadline
- **Limited** - 3-5 KRs per objective

### Key Result Types

**1. Metric-Based KRs**:
- "Increase daily active users from 10K to 25K"
- "Reduce page load time from 3s to 1.5s"
- "Achieve 90% customer satisfaction score"

**2. Milestone-Based KRs**:
- "Launch and onboard 50 enterprise customers"
- "Complete migration to microservices architecture"
- "Ship 5 new features in the mobile app"

**3. Binary/Completion KRs**:
- "Achieve SOC 2 compliance"
- "Open source the SDK"
- "Hire and onboard 5 engineers"

---

## Phase 3: Monthly Planning Structure

**Goal**: Break down quarterly OKRs into actionable monthly milestones

### Monthly OKR Template

See [`assets/monthly-okr-template.md`](assets/monthly-okr-template.md) for complete template structure.

### Monthly Planning Process

1. **Review Previous Month**
   - What worked well?
   - What didn't achieve targets?
   - What lessons learned?

2. **Set Monthly Objectives**
   - Align with quarterly goals
   - Focus on 2-3 major objectives
   - Ensure achievability in one month

3. **Define Monthly Key Results**
   - Break quarterly KRs into monthly milestones
   - Set specific, measurable targets
   - Assign owners and due dates

4. **Identify Dependencies**
   - What do you need from others?
   - What blocks progress?
   - What resources are required?

5. **Track and Review**
   - Weekly progress check-ins
   - Adjust if needed (max 1-2 changes)
   - End-of-month scoring

## OKR Scoring

**Goal**: Measure achievement objectively

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Achievement | Definition |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **1.0** | 100% | Exceeded expectations |
| **0.7** | 70% | Target achieved (good!) |
| **0.4** | 40% | Made progress, but fell short |
| **0.0** | 0% | No progress made |

### Scoring Guidelines

- **0.6-0.7 is the sweet spot** - OKRs should be ambitious
- Don't sandbag (setting easy goals to hit 1.0)
- Don't set impossible goals (consistently scoring 0.0)
- Average OKR score should be 0.6-0.7

## Common OKR Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Too many OKRs | Loss of focus | Limit to 3-5 objectives per period |
| Activity-based OKRs | "Ship 5 features" without outcome | Focus on outcomes, not output |
| Sandbagging | Consistently scoring 1.0 | Set more ambitious goals |
| No alignment | Individual goals don't connect | Ensure each OKR links to broader goals |
| Set and forget | No progress tracking | Weekly check-ins required |
| Low ambition | Easy, safe goals | Aim for 60-70% achievement |

## Best Practices

1. **Start with why** - Each OKR should answer "why does this matter?"
2. **Make them visible** - Public dashboards, regular updates
3. **Review weekly** - Short check-ins, adjust course
4. **Score at period end** - Honest assessment, learn from failure
5. **Celebrate learning** - Failure is OK if you learned something
6. **Keep it simple** - 3-5 objectives, 3-5 KRs each
7. **Cascading alignment** - Individual → Team → Company
